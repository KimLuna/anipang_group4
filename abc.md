## Data Structure Improvements

### 1. Animal Representation
**Before**: `string board[7][7]` (1,568 bytes)
**After**: `enum Animal board[7][7]` (196 bytes)
**Rationale**: Reduced memory usage and faster comparisons

### 2. DFS Implementation
**Before**: Recursive with risk of stack overflow
**After**: Iterative using std::stack
**Code Example**:
```cpp
// Your optimized code snippet
```
```

### 2. Algorithm Optimizations
- Explain each major algorithmic improvement
- Include time complexity analysis
- Provide code snippets showing before/after

### 3. Challenges and Solutions
- What problems did you encounter?
- How did you solve them?
- What trade-offs did you make?

## Code Quality Requirements

Your optimized code must:

### 1. Maintain Functionality

### 2. Include Performance Measurements
```cpp
// Example of integrated timing code
class AnipangGame {
public:
    void hasValidMoves() {
        #ifdef MEASURE_PERFORMANCE
        auto start = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        #endif
        
        // Your optimized code
        
        #ifdef MEASURE_PERFORMANCE
        auto end = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        recordTime("hasValidMoves", start, end);
        #endif
    }
};
```
